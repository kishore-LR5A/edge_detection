### Issues faced
1. Was not able to build the apk without errors. Error was <b>Module was compiled with an incompatible version of Kotlin. The binary version of its metadata is 1.7.1, expected version is 1.5.1 .</b>
2. So sending you the apk of debug version and not release version. Click [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ddfaDhv-vJl99VvpV9bITdDJWWD85TjC/view?usp=share_link) to get the apk
3. Not deployed to playstore because play console registration itself is USD 25.
